FreeCodeCamp Madlibs Homework Project:
This code creates a madlibs game based on the story Twas the Night Before Christmas.
The user is asked to insert several words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc).
When the user has finished inputting the words, the madlibs is generated and printed to the console.
